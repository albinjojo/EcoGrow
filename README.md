# 🌱 EcoGrow – Greenhouse Environment Monitoring System

EcoGrow is an IoT-based greenhouse monitoring system that uses an ESP32 and sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and CO₂ levels in real time. An AI model analyzes these readings to check whether the environment is safe for plant growth or if it may lead to harmful bacteria or fungal development. The system provides alerts when conditions become risky and also stores historical data to help farmers understand environmental changes over time.

## ⭐ What EcoGrow Does
- Monitors temperature, humidity, and CO₂ inside a greenhouse  
- Uses AI to detect unsafe environmental conditions  
- Predicts chances of bacteria or fungus growth  
- Sends alerts when conditions become risky  
- Shows historical readings and trend graphs  
- Helps farmers maintain a healthy environment for their crops  

## ⭐ How EcoGrow Works
1. **ESP32 Sensor Module**  
   The ESP32 collects temperature, humidity, and CO₂ data using connected sensors.

2. **Data Transfer to Backend**  
   Sensor readings are sent to the backend server for processing.

3. **AI Analysis**  
   An AI model checks whether conditions are ideal or may lead to bacterial/fungal growth.

4. **Alerts & Recommendations**  
   The system notifies the user when environmental risk increases.

5. **History & Trends**  
   All readings are stored and displayed as easy-to-understand historical data.
