🌱 EcoGrow – Greenhouse Environment Monitoring System

EcoGrow is an IoT-based greenhouse monitoring system that uses an ESP32 and sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and CO₂ levels in real time. An AI model checks whether these conditions are safe for plant growth or if they could lead to harmful bacterial or fungal development. The system provides alerts when the environment becomes risky and also shows a history of past readings to help farmers understand how greenhouse conditions change over time.

⭐ What EcoGrow Does

Monitors temperature, humidity, and CO₂ in a greenhouse

Uses an AI model to detect unsafe conditions

Predicts chances of bacteria or fungus growth

Sends alerts when risk is high

Shows historical data and trends for better understanding

Helps farmers maintain a healthy environment for their crops

⭐ How EcoGrow Works

ESP32 Sensor Module
The ESP32 collects temperature, humidity, and CO₂ data using connected sensors.

Data Transfer to Backend
The ESP32 sends all readings to the backend for processing.

AI Analysis
The backend uses an AI model to check if current conditions are safe or may lead to bacteria/fungal growth.

Alerts & Recommendations
The system warns the user when conditions become unsafe.

History & Trends
All readings are stored so the user can view past environmental patterns.
